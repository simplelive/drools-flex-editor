#summary Road map for the project

   # Add a tree pattern match for syntax highlighting and code completion (http://www.nedit.org/)
   # Intentional programming - create rules automatically based on user intent
   # Create visual representations of code blocks, and allow code blocks to be "snapped" together. 
   # Smart indentation
   # Consider ways of creating simpler methods to target none-developers
   # Consider complexity in the development of rules
