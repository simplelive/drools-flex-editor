## About ##
This project is a full blown IDE for the Drools Rule Engine written in Adobe Flex. Although, the actual front-end can be adopted to work for any language.

## Goal ##
The goal of this project is to create a viable alternative to author rules online rather than offline in Eclipse, text files, or some other uncouth method.

## Reasons ##
The reason to choose Adobe Flex is that it compiles into a flash file that can run on any browser or any IDE via Adobe AIR. The other reason is that Flex allows for a very rich user experience.

The reason to focus on Drools Rule Engine is that it's a leading open source Rules Engine and lacks in a sophisticated web based rule authoring UI.
